* What's in a name?

The acronym LCATR originally meant *LSST CCD Acceptance Testing
Results*.  After it was begun, its scope was expanded to cover both
CCDs and RTMs (generically "units").  An alternative meaning might be
*LIMS Client for Acceptance Testing Results* as it's primary purpose
is to interface between the Laboratory Information Management System
and the actual software that runs CCD/RTM test hardware or analyses
that run on the output of such tests.  Finally, might best be called
*Look Carefully And Take Responsibility* as it is meant to assure that
the tests and analysis software programs are run to completion and
known software versions and run-time environment are specified, used
and recorded.

* Parts of LCATR

LCATR has some diverse responsibilities both in terms of what it
provides and what test and analysis authors must supply.  These are
documented in the following:

 - [[./design.org][Design for LSST CCD/RTM Test Software System]] :: an overall picture of how the system works.

 - [[./developer.org][LCATR Job Developer Instructions]] :: what an author of an LCATR job needs to know.

 - [[./installation.org][LCATR Job Installation]] :: how software for an LCATR job should be installed.

 - [[./lims-harness-api.org][The LIMS and Job Harness API]] :: agreement on communication between LIMS and LCATR.

 - [[./modulefiles.org][Describing LSST Sensor Test Software Environment with Modules]] :: how test/analysis software sets up its run-time environment.

 - [[./schema.org][LCATR Schema]] :: required format for writing data into the LIMS database from an LCATR job.

 - [[./jobharness.org][LSST CCD Test Job Harness]] :: details on the /job harness/ 

 - [[./dirhier.org][Global organization of results and source files for LSST CCD testing]] :: details of organization of result files.

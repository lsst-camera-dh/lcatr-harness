* What's in a name?

The acronym LCATR originally meant *LSST CCD Acceptance Testing
Results*.  After it was begun, its scope was expanded to cover both
CCDs and RTMs (generically "units").  An alternative meaning might be
*LIMS Client for Acceptance Testing Results* as it's primary purpose
is to interface between the Laboratory Information Management System
and the actual software that runs CCD/RTM test hardware or analyses
that run on the output of such tests.  Finally, might best be called
*Look Carefully And Take Responsibility* as it is meant to assure that
the tests and analysis software programs are run to completion and
known software versions and run-time environment are specified, used
and recorded.

* Parts of LCATR

LCATR has some diverse responsibilities both in terms of what it
provides and what test and analysis authors must supply.  These are
documented in the following:

 - [[./design.org][design]] :: an overall picture of how the system works.

 - [[./developer.org][developer]] :: what an author of an LCATR job needs to know.

 - [[./installation.org][installation]] :: how software for an LCATR job should be installed.

 - [[./lims-harness-api.org][LIMS/harness API]] :: agreement on communication between LIMS and LCATR.

 - [[./modulefiles.org][environment modules]] :: how test/analysis software sets up its run-time environment.

 - [[./schema.org][schema]] :: required format for writing data into the LIMS database from an LCATR job.

 - [[./testing.org][testing]] :: how to test LCATR or test/analysis software under LCATR

 - [[./roles.org][roles]] :: some roles for individuals participating in LCATR

 - [[./jobharness.org][job harness details]] :: details on the /job harness/ 

 - [[./dirhier.org][file system layout]] :: details of organization of result files.

 - [[./todo.org][todo items]] :: attempt to keep track of where we are and where we are going

 - [[./releases.org][making releases]] :: some notes on how releases of the job harness software are made

See the file scripts/lcatr-release

The following may be of interest

1. scripts/lcatr-release bump_version <version-string>

updates everything with embedded version string if necessary. Does nothing
if it's already at requested version

2. scripts/lcatr-release commit_and_tag

does git commit -a (so commits all new, unstaged versions of files it
already knows about; does not add new files)

then tags with current version string

3a. scripts/lcatr-release push   or
3b. scripts/lcatr-release push_origin_master

First pushes all commits and tags to origin; second pushes only along
master branch

4. scripts/lcatr-release release_no_sdist <version-string>

Does 1, 2 and 3b in sequence.


Convention for version-string is:
for a real release,  integers separated by . (e.g. 2.0.4)
for a candidate release, same as above but followed by -<somethng>, e.g.
2.0.5-RC
